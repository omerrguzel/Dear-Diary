* First screen is splash screen which displays app logo
* Second screen is login screen which you can login with "admin" as both username and password.
* Third screen displays previous logs of your diary. Clicking back button in this screen exits application instead of going back to login screen. By clicking plus button you can add a new log.(Week3-Hw2)
* Fourth screen is where you write about your day. You should choose date and color of the day. Because each day has its color :smile:. This screen saves state of your inputs.(Week3-Hw1)
